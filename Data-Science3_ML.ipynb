    "The MAE value of 2.927885650956976 represents the average magnitude of errors between the predicted and actual values. A lower MAE indicates better model performance. In this case, a MAE of 2.93 suggests that, on average, the predicted gross income differs from the actual gross income by approximately $2.93. However, without additional context, it is difficult to assess whether this MAE value is good or bad. It is recommended to compare it with other models or benchmarks in the same domain to determine its adequacy.\n",

    "The R-squared score of 0.8881180842629107 measures the proportion of the variance in the gross income that can be explained by the Quantity and Unit Price variables. It ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating a perfect fit. In this case, an R-squared value of 0.8881 suggests that approximately 88.81% of the variability in the gross income can be explained by the Quantity and Unit Price variables. Generally, a higher R-squared value is considered better, but the interpretation depends on the specific context and the available benchmarks."
